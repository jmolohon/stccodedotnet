I'm sorry to announce there is no meeting this month. I was unable to get a speaker commitment for February.  This is one of the most challenging aspects of organizing this group.  If you or someone you know would be able to share .Net related expertise in a public demo format, please contact me by e-mail (james at stccode dot net).

Regards,
James
