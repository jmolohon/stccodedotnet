During this 90 minute session we’ll give a brief overview of the Windows Azure Platform and some of the myths and hidden truths of this new application development platform. You’ll get a basic introduction to what it is and what it isn’t as we try to penetrate the fog and get to the heart of Microsoft’s most significant technology shift since it abandoned MS-DOS.

Brent Stineman is a Manager and National Solution Lead for Microsoft Cloud Services with Sogeti USA. His 18+ year IT career has spanned platforms from the mainframe to mobile devices. However, he’s spent the bulk of the last 10 years working on internet applications and distributed system development. Brent started working with the Windows Azure platform early in its CTP phase and is now focused on helping colleagues and clients explore the promise of cloud computing. Brent was selected as one of the first  Microsoft MVP’s for the Windows Azure Platform in October of 2010 and later recognized as co-MVP of the year for this technical discipline.
