Addressing a .NET application performance issue requires a little more than luck. And it almost always requires more than running a magical tool to find the bottleneck. In this presentation Tom Fischer discusses both the technical and non-technical lessons he has learned over the years resolving.NET application performance issues.

Tom Fischer works as an independent software contractor designing and developing Microsoft-based solutions. His professional experience ranges from delivering complex business information solutions to designing rich user interfaces. Based on these experiences Tom has written and presented on a wide variety of subjects over the past 15 years.
