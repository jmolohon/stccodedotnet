Over the last year, a number of "Micro ORM" libraries have been released which offer many of the advantages of full featured ORMs but do not require learning a new GUI designer or query language. These libraries make use many of the new C# 3.0 and C# 4.0 language features in interesting ways. At this presentation, we'll look at two Micro ORMs (dapper-dot-net and Simple.Data) and explore (using VS 11) how C# 3.0 and 4.0 features (like anonymous types and dynamic objects) could be used to modernize a legacy code base.
