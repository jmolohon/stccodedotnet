On March 9th, we were fortunate to have Brent Edwards deliver his Getting Dirty with Windows Phone 7 presentation.  It was very eye-opening and helped me grasp some new concepts.  [Click to view Brent's presentation materials.](http://brentedwards.net/2011/03/05/getting-dirty-with-windows-phone-7-presentation-materials/)

If you have an interest in participating in the [Telerik phone competition](http://www.telerik.com/products/windows-phone/getting-started/user-groups.aspx) that they've opened up to user group members, please let me know when your app is published so I can submit it to Telerik.  If your app is a winner, we'll split the $100 50/50.

And another reason to start your WP7 development project -
Microsoft is also running a contest for WP7 developers.  Theirs is a random chance to win a new phone.  All you have to do is submit your app to the marketplace by June 30th.
Use event code VIL12 when submitting your app.  More details are here

So you have two opportunities to win, and you keep all rights to your app!

Oh yeah, here's a [free ebook from Charles Petzold](http://www.charlespetzold.com/phone/) to help you get started with your new app.
