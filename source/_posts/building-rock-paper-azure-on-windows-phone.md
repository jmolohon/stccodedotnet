Are you interested in learning about mobile development?  Cloud services?  Gaming? Our November meeting will target Windows Phone and the Microsoft stack to develop a mobile game.

This end-to-end scenario talk demonstrates how Windows Azure enables and extends the reach of mobile applications with the example of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game played on the phone against a service hosted in the cloud. Starting from a blank slate this talk showcases the use of Access Control Services to use identity from Google, Yahoo and Live ID to authenticate the user, then implements a SQL Azure database to store game history. Finally it implements the game interface using Silverlight on Windows Phone 7.1 pulling information from a WCF Data Service that exposes an OData endpoint from an Entity Framework data model.

Mike Benkovich delivers technical presentations around the U.S. as a developer evangelist on the MSDN team at Microsoft. He has worked in a variety of professional roles, including architect, project manager, developer, and technical writer. Mike is also a published author of books from WROX Press and APress that show developers how to get the most from their SQL databases. Since appearing in the 1994 Microsoft DevCast, Mike has presented technical information at seminars, conferences, and corporate boardrooms across America.
