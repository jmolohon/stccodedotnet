Last year, Mike Emo demonstrated building a single page application using KnockoutJS, Breeze, and WebAPI. This year Mike has decided to present SPA using AnguarJS and WebAPI. In this demo, he will develop an ecommerce application, displaying and filtering products, adding and removing them to a cart and finally checking out. After this demonstration you should have insight into the anatomy of an AngularJS application, and an understanding of where to begin learning AngularJS.
