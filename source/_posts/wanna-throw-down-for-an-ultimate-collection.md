Announced at the March meetup, we're looking for a few devs who'd like to test their Ninja-like dev skills against other competitive members for a chance to win the Telerik Ultimate Collection license.  This is the first time we've done something like this, so the rules are going to be pretty simple.

Here's the lowdown. Your solution must have been developed in 2012, and utilize a Telerik UI component.  It doesn't matter if your app is a web app, a desktop app, or a mobile app.  The components you choose can be any of the .NET controls, or the Kendo UI for HTML5\.  You'll have to be present at the meeting to demo your app, and describe your experience developing with the Telerik controls.  Finally, an impartial jury of 3 peers will be assembled to judge the competition.  Judging will be based on 3 qualities of your solution:

*   Originality
*   Creativity
*   Interest
The winner will be awarded a Telerik Ultimate Collection license.  Other contestants will be awarded consolation prizes, and be eligible to re-enter the competition at a future event.

To enter the contest, post a reply right here on this posting,or talk some smack on our LinkedIn group discussion board. The first event will take place at the April meetup.

The Telerik tools can be downloaded and used to develop for free. There is a nagging reminder that the tools are not licensed, but you should be able to continue to develop with the trial version without worrying about an expiration date.
