<div>Battleships  may be a symbol of great power, but battleship grey apparently doesn’t  make a very powerful statement when building user interfaces. So many  developers don’t “do pretty”. After all, good UI takes a very different  skill set than cranking code. But Expression Blend has made it possible  for developers to make “pretty” UI. In this session we’ll see some  simple ways for non-designers to leverage the basic features of Blend to  go beyond Battleship grey.</div>
