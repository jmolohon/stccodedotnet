Do you ever think your unit test should be more readable?
Do you feel your unit tests don’t align with the language of the business?
Do you not see the benefits of TDD or just have a hard time knowing what to test?
Do you find yourself over building backend components?
Do you struggle with the traditional inside-out approach typically described as TDD?
Do you want good documentation but don’t know how to make time for it?
Do you want to do more UI level testing but want to stay within the friendly confines of C# &amp; .Net?
Have you had issues in production where it was not clear if the issue is a bug or not?

&nbsp;

This will not be an overly in depth discussion around the semantics of behavior driven development (BDD).  We will briefly describe some of the tenants of BDD and dive right into one way you can implement this in your code.  We will cover a lot of ground in the time we have.  I will be demonstrating how to implement a flavor of BDD using a sample project where we will be coming up with the business requirements around a ubiquitous problem so we can focus on implementation.  By coming to St. Cloud .Net Users Group on November 14<sup>th</sup>, you get a glimpse of the tools below.
