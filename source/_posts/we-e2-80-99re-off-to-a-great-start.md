On Wednesday evening we held our first event. Professionals from local Saint Cloud businesses such as GeoComm, W3i, Wolters-Kluwer, and RTE were also joined by many students from Saint Cloud State University and Saint Cloud Technical and Community College.

Mike Benkovich presented highlights of the recent Microsoft Professional Developer Conference held in Redmond, Washington. There was a lot of terrific news and material to cover. In this session Mike focused on the Client and Devices portion and covered Internet Explorer 9 Beta and Windows Phone 7.Frankly, there was so much to cover in the time we allowed we didn’t get through everything we wanted.  So Mike has promised to return and discuss Cloud Services, Framework and Tools.

All of this was pretty interesting to developers who are considering getting into the mobile game.  If you’re interested in learning more about developing phone apps, check out the group meeting at W3i’s office.  More information about that group can be found at http://mobilestcloud.com.

We’re looking forward to the next meeting in December, and hope to see you then!

PS.  This event was recorded, and we’ll post links to the video as soon as it’s available.
