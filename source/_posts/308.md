# Dipping Your Toes Into Mobile: The Low-Hanging Fruit

Mobile development used to be a niche development platform. Many of us shied away from it due to unfamiliarity, lack of computing power, diversity of development environments for different devices or because we scoffed at its insignificance. Those of us who did are now behind the times. Mobile browsing will be the PRIMARY browsing environment in the next couple of years and just about everybody has a smart phone and/or tablet. The revolution is here and you must adapt. For the developer that's been reluctant to make the switch, we'll be going over the low-hanging fruit that's been developed in the last few years by people sharing your concerns that will help you ease into the mobile development world including PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile, mobile websites and responsive web design.

Vince Bullinger has been a passionate .Net developer and consultant since 2005\. He has an MCSD for .NET with C#. In his spare time, he likes to work on home projects, work out, play video games and learn everything there is to know about everything.

# Construction Zone Ahead

We're going to be experiencing major road construction near our regular location for the next 4 or 5 months.  The intersection of Highway 15 and County Road 120 will be transformed into a[diverging diamond interchange](http://www.stcloudapo.org/uploads/1/2/8/7/12874227/hwy15ddihowto.pdf),. We're moving this months meeting to Rasmussen College, off Highway 15 and 2nd Street South in Saint Cloud.  This is not a permanent move, and we'll continue to scout locations for our meetups to accommodate easy access.  If you'd like to host an event at your office, please contact me at [james@stccode.net](mailto:james@stccode.net).

#### Cheers!
