Our next meeting will be February 8th with Joel Dahlin presenting "More jQuery Lessons From the Trenches" and will be held at the new Cloud Coworking offices on 5th Ave downtown.

This will also be a special celebration month.  The International .NET Association, (INETA) is our parent organization, and they are celebrating their 10th birthday.  We've been a part of that organization for one year now.
