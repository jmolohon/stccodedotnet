We don't have a speaker lined up for this month, but that doesn't mean we can't have a meetup.  We can discuss what is happening at the Build conference, and some ideas for changing the format of the meetings for the next year. I'd especially like to hear from you, and learn what area's of .NET are of interest for you and your work.  I hope you'll be able to join us this month at the Library.  And yes, we've got pizza and stuff to give away.
