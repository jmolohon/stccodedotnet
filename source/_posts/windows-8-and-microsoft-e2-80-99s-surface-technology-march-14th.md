This month we're going to have Dave Ward guide us through his explorations of Win8 and the Visual Studio 11 preview. Plus a look at the Surface SDK operating on a Samsung tablet. This should be cool. Bring your thoughts to the conversation about what Microsoft is doing with the new VS11.

We're also going to do a limited-trial Skype call, so if you can't physically be here, you can still participate. If that's you, choose the "I'm on Skype" ticket.
