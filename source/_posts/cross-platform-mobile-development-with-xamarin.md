Creating enterprise-caliber mobile applications presents a myriad of problems. One of those problems is having an entirely separate team of developers with an entirely separate skillset for each platform on which you'd like your app to work. Cross-platform mobile development seeks to alleviate this problem.

In this talk, we'll take a deep-dive into the Xamarin framework. We'll take an in-depth look at the Xamarin approach to solving this problem, as well as briefly touch upon native development and other technologies' cross-platform solutions and when each one may be appropriate to use. We'll also go over some best practices for Xamarin development for the enterprise environment and take a look at tools associated with Xamarin.

Presented by Vince Bullinger
Vince has been a passionate developer and consultant since 2005\. He is currently an independent contractor. He received his MCSD for .NET with C# back in 2008\. In recent years, he's immersed himself in front end technologies. Even more recently, he's developed a passion for mobile development, specifically of the cross-platform variety.

Following Vinces' presentation we'll be celebrating INETA's 12th birthday.  Who's INETA? That's the International .NET Association that this group joined when we launched 4 years ago.  Their association links us with many sponsors who contribute door prizes and swag that we give away, and they like to make their birthday a big deal.  So please come and join us!
