after all, summer just doesn't last too long in Minnesota.  So this month we're going to call it George, or maybe "by George", and not host an evening meetup.

I do, however, have a few recommendations for you.  [The Rotary Club presents a summer concert series linked here.](http://summertimebygeorge.com/pages/August) So if your calendar is still open on the 10th, you could put  on your dancing shoes and boogie down by Lake George with Diamondback with a totally different segment of our local community.

And an upcoming event of special interest to all web developers, K. Scott Allen, @odetocode, will be presenting at the [Twin Cities DNUG](http://www.tcdnug.com/) on the 15th.  This should not be missed if you're working with MVC / Entity Framework / jQuery.

Thanks, and I hope to see you all after the break!
