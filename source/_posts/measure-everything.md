Ever wondered how long your pages take to load, how long your api calls are taking, and how to measure this in a simple manner. Want a really simple way to track this data, and a simple way to output visualizations of that data? Welcome to the world of StatsD and Graphite. I will go through how StatsD has affected NativeX’s knowledge about our systems, and our measurements of those systems. We will talk about how it has simplified our processes and our abilities to tell if a release has gone bad. We will dive into a little bit of code and some of our best practices, as well as creating some pretty graphs. At the end I will show you some of our backend tools which we have developed to help us analyze our data, and measure everything that we release.
