Thanks to everybody who participated and helped make this user group great.  We're eagerly anticipating exciting topics and events in the coming year.  Be ready to join us when we announce our up coming events.  There have been a lot of exciting announcements around OSS and VS2013, Azure, node.js, one ASP.NET.  We're working now to bring speakers to our area to share their knowledge and expertise on all these topics.  See you soon, and have a happy holiday season.

ps.  We're celebrating INETA's birthday with our own party in February!
