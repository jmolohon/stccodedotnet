Ready to take your javascript skills a notch higher? Microsoft's AJAX team has been contributing to the open source jQuery project. jQuery is designed to change the way that you write javascript. It's lightweight, CSS3 and cross-browser compliant. In this talk, Mike Van Nevel will cover the basics of javascript and jQuery, and HTML manipulations.

Mike is a senior software developer at W3i, and loves sports and creating core libraries. He sharpened his jQuery axe buildingÂ [FlipToast](http://fliptoast.com), an awesome Facebook client built for your desktop. He's been learning WP7, Action Script, Adobe Flex and Adobe MXML, and recently worked with a hackathon project team that built a prototype WP7 game for the Nerf warrior called Son of a Gun.
