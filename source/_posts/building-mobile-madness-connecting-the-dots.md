The only thing that’s constant is change, and nowhere is that more true than in mobile technology. New phones, tablets and phablets mean new opportunities for developers to create great ways of connecting people and the data that makes things possible. In this talk we’ll explore how you can go cross platform with data, identity and services to create the ultimate connected experience. From Android and iOS to HTML and Windows we will show you how to build applications that share data and identity, and connect applications with the cloud.
