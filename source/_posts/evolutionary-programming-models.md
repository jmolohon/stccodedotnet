Jason Bock gave us an excellent opportunity this month to learn about evolutionary programming models.Â  There were quite a few interesting examples that are available online, including Boxcar2d and EvoLisa. If you didn't get an opportunity to listen to him in Saint Cloud, he'll be presenting it again in [Sioux Falls on May 30th](http://sfdnug.com/).

Some key takeaways from his presentation:

*   Building function files and compiling on the fly (csc.exe)
*   Concurrency (using Tasks) - check out the book by Joe Duffy

Thanks again to Jason for making it a fun evening.
