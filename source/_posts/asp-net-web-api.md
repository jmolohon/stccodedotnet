Oh boy, more acronym confusion. With MVC 4 Microsoft is introducing a new Web API. They have named it the ‘ASP.Net Web API’. This new feature is Microsoft’s answer to the question ‘How should we do Restful services in the .Net Stack?’ Pulling the good from both MVC 3 and the WCF Web API this new framework promises to make the development of Rest based services easier, cleaner and in general much more fun. In this session we will walk through the process of building a new service. And along the way we will see how we can handle multiple media types, authentication, validation, as well as POCO integration with the Entity Framework.
