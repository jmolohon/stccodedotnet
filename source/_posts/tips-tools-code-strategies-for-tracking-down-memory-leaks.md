Did you know that memory leaks can be found in most applications.  Typically memory leaks aren’t addressed until the application begins to perform slow or crash un-expectantly. In this talk we’ll cover a wide range of topics to help you understand the difference between a memory leak and  poor use of memory.  We’ll spend some time talking about the Garbage Collector and the coding patterns that result in leaks in the managed world.  I will share some code that can help solve common memory leak patterns.  I’ll demonstrate tools I have built to help track down leaks and share those tools with you.  And most importantly I will show you easy and proven strategies that you can use to detect memory leaks in your applications.
