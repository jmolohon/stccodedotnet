[![Eventbrite - Scaling with Cassandra](http://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=6563610937)](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/6563610937?ref=ebtnebregn)

NativeX (formerly W3i) recently transitioned a large portion of their backend infrastructure from MS SQL Server to Apache Cassandra. Today, its Cassandra cluster backs its mobile advertising network supporting over 10 million daily active users producing over 10,000 transactions per second with an average database request latency of under 2 milliseconds. Going from relational to noSQL required NativeX’s engineers to re-train, re-tool and re-think the way it architects applications and infrastructure. Learn why Cassandra was selected as a replacement, what challenges were encountered along the way, and what architecture and infrastructure were involved in the implementation.
