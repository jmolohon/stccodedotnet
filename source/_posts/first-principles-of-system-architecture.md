If part of your job is designing architecture for a system then I'm sure you'll find this talk interesting. Many of us find ourselves struggling to keep up with the complexity of the evolving systems we support. Have you applied best practices but still feel like you could have better - a lot better? I have. Come find out what I've been learning about how to achieve some harmony in the design of an enterprise system. Find out how the lessons of OOP, SOA, EDA, DDD, CQRS, and other buzzwords can be distilled into a core set of first principles. Using these ideas I hope to share how to begin thinking about architecture instead of learning how to copy architecture. I'll be demonstrating this thinking in practice by walking you through the design of an online ordering system, and I'll leave you with the resources you need to continue your journey.
