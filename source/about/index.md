The Saint Cloud .NET User Group exists to provide a community forum to promote the use of Microsoft .NET technologies, and network and share knowledge and experience with other members.  Membership is open to any person interested in learning about Microsoft .NET.
We strive to bring excellent speakers to our monthly meetings, and provide these meetings at no cost to our members.
